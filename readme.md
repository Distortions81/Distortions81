## About Me

I‚Äôm a builder at heart. I move fluidly between code, electronics, and data‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs writing Go servers and game engines, hacking Factorio mods, tuning Linux systems, or modeling solar batteries. I like to peel back abstractions, test assumptions, and make trade-offs visible with graphs, benchmarks, and prototypes.  

I treat every project as an experiment: build, measure, refine, repeat. My repos reflect that tinkerer-scientist loop‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs a polished tool, other times it‚Äôs a weird prototype that scratches an itch. Either way, it‚Äôs hands-on, data-driven, and open to exploration.  

I value efficiency and leverage: scripts that automate, formats that clarify, visualizations that reveal. If there‚Äôs friction between an idea and a working system, I want to sand it down.  

In short: I don‚Äôt just use systems‚ÄîI take them apart, rebuild them, and see how far they can be pushed.
