**Highlights:**
- Game data parsing
- Tile-based rendering with Ebiten
- Interactive seed exploration

### [goXA](https://github.com/Distortions81/goXA)
**Language:** Go | **Complexity:** Medium-Low
Custom archiving utility with a compact format. Focuses on efficient file packing and easy CLI extraction for game assets.

**Highlights:**
- File I/O in Go
- Custom archive structure
- CLI packaging and unpacking

### [goMMO](https://github.com/Distortions81/goMMO)
**Language:** Go | **Complexity:** Medium-Low
Client-side MMO prototype demonstrating basic networking. Implements a small world simulation and WebSocket communication for testing.

**Highlights:**
- WebSocket networking
- Client-server communication
- Minimal game engine

### [PixelPirates](https://github.com/Distortions81/PixelPirates)
